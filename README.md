## ✨ Key Features

* **SaaS-Grade UI**: Features a professional layout with high-contrast violet gradients (#7c3aed), spaced-out typography (`tracking-widest`), and a "Bento-style" About page.
* **Persistent Cart Engine**: Integrated with `localStorage` via **Context API** to ensure your shopping cart and user session survive browser refreshes.
* **Protected Checkout Flow**: Advanced routing system that guards the checkout process—redirecting unauthorized users to a custom "Login as Guest" portal.
* **Dynamic Inventory**: Real-time product synchronization using the **DummyJSON API** with built-in loading states and sophisticated error handling.
* **Micro-Interactions**: Polished UI elements including scale-on-hover product cards, backdrop-blur navigation, and smooth transition effects.
* **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for all screen sizes; features a 4-column fluid grid on desktop and a clean stacked mobile view for maximum accessibility.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React.js**: For component-based architecture and robust state management.
* **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and a professional high-contrast theme.
* **React Router v6**: For handling dynamic paths, nested routes, and Private Route protection.
* **Context API**: Global state management for both **Authentication** and **Cart Logic**.
